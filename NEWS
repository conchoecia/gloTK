====================
 v0.1.14 - 20161102
====================

* Gave a --triplet flag to glotk-sweep to cause the assembler to run diploid modes
  0, 1, and 2 on the same kmer size.

====================
 v0.1.13 - 20161102
====================

* Made glotk-sweep function by inputting each value of k to assemble for, rather
  than using 'sweep start', 'sweep stop', and 'sweep interval'.
  Usage is: '--slist 23 27 57' to perform assemblies for those three values


=========
 v0.1.12
=========

* Fixed an error where not specifying the start index or assembly
  prefix caused the names to generate incorrectly or the program to
  crash.
* Added a test to verify that the assembler is working in sweep mode,
  including test data.
