The reads in this directory were obtained from the DNA Data Bank of
Japan (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) on 28 August 2016
from accession number SRS267238.

These data were generated as part of the following paper: Minoche AE,
Dohm JC, Himmelbauer H. Evaluation of genomic high-throughput
sequencing data generated on Illumina HiSeq and genome analyzer
systems. Genome Biol. 2011;12(11):R112.

The reads in the reads/ directory were generated with the following
commands executed in the same directory where the SRS267238 fastq.bz2
files were downloaded.

bzip2 -d SRR353630_1.fastq.bz2 | seqtk sample -s113 - 2500 | awk -v OFS='\t' '{if (NR%4==1) print "@"$2"/1"; else print;}' | gzip -c > SRR353630_2500_1.fastq.gz
bzip2 -d SRR353630_2.fastq.bz2 | seqtk sample -s113 - 2500 | awk -v OFS='\t' '{if (NR%4==1) print "@"$2"/2"; else print;}' | gzip -c > SRR353630_2500_2.fastq.gz

The following copyright waiver for this data can be found here:

Quoted from the above website:

    DDBJ data set is an accumulation of DNA records submitted to either
    DDBJ, GenBank and EMBL-Bank as a world wide collaborative effort
    called INSDC (International Nucleotide Sequence Database
    Collaboration).

    Although DDBJ does not impose any control over the use of any part of
    the accumulated records, there have not been any copyright transfer
    from authors of the records upon submission. This is the reason why
    we, DDBJ, avoid making any definite statement that anybody may freely
    copy/modify/redistribute any part of the data set.

    Since 2002, we ask all submitting authors to read the following
    policy, according to the advice from International Advisory Committee.

    "The INSD will not attach statements to records that restrict access
    to the data, limit the use of information in these records, or
    prohibit certain types of publications based on these
    records. Specifically, no use restrictions or licensing requirements
    will be included in any sequence data records, and no restrictions or
    licensing fees will be placed on the redistribution or use of the
    database by any party."

    We believe that by doing this we obtain, in effect, a permission
    equivalent to a waiver of copyright from authors. In fact, no author
    of the DDBJ records have claimed any restriction about the reuse of
    any part of the data set by the third parties until know.

    Hence, DDBJ data set is a quasi-public domain data, which is made by
    the collaboration of the many and which can be reused freely.
